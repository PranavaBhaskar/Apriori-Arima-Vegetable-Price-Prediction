# Apriori-Arima-Vegetable-Price-Prediction

About the Project:
This project integrates association rule mining (Apriori) with time series forecasting to analyze and 
predict vegetable stock prices purchased by retailers across seasons. Using historical price data, we 
identify key products with high seasonal price spreads and uncover strong co-occurrence patterns 
among them. The Apriori-based analysis highlights frequent product associations that inform 
strategic stocking decisions. Concurrently, a Seasonal ARIMA model forecasts future farm prices 
accounting for both trends and yearly seasonality providing accurate long-term price projections. 
The hybrid model empowers retailers to optimize procurement, anticipate market fluctuations, and 
plan inventory more effectively. Visualizations of association networks, seasonal patterns, and 
forecasted prices enhance interpretability and actionable insights, supporting data-driven decision
making in agricultural retail markets.
